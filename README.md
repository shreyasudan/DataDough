## Introduction ü§ì
Welcome to DataDough, a data science project focused on exploring the fascinating realm of data and uncovering insights related to salaries of data scientists. In today's data-driven world, understanding the factors that influence data scientists' salaries is crucial for both professionals and organizations alike. This project aims to shed light on the various factors that contribute to the salaries of data scientists and provide valuable insights into this ever-evolving field.

The dataset `salary` contains data on not only the salaries of data scientists, but also their experience, salary in USD, residence, company's location, and company's size. 

This project not only seeks to answer questions about salary trends but also aims to explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on compensation. By examining the interplay between factors like work experience, employment type, and company size, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can aid professionals in negotiating salaries and assist organizations in formulating competitive compensation packages.

To accomplish these objectives, we employ a range of analytical techniques and tools, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and plotly to perform data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

Here are the components of our project:

## Part I : Inferential Analysis üî¨üî¨

### Data Cleaning üßπ üßΩ
After looking at some preliminary statistics for `salary`, we decided to undertake the following steps to clean our data and prepare it for use:

1. `remote_ratio` column was divided by 100 to ensure scalability and correctness if the column were to be used as a numeric feature in a model.
2. `work_year` was converted to string type as it is a categorical feature here and the interpretation of the 'mean' of the `work_year` in the descriptive statistics is meaningless.

Here are the premliminary descriptive statistics of `salary`:

|       |   work_year |        salary |   salary_in_usd |   remote_ratio |
|:------|------------:|--------------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| count | 3755        |   3755        |          3755   |      3755      |
| mean  | 2022.37     | 190696        |        137570   |        46.2716 |
| std   |    0.691448 | 671677        |         63055.6 |        48.5891 |
| min   | 2020        |   6000        |          5132   |         0      |
| 25%   | 2022        | 100000        |         95000   |         0      |
| 50%   | 2022        | 138000        |        135000   |         0      |
| 75%   | 2023        | 180000        |        175000   |       100      |

### EDA üìä
As part of our EDA we explored the relationship and the distribution of the following variables:
1. The Distribution of `salary_in_usd`
    - **Observations**: The distribution of salaries (USD) is fairly normal, and slightly right-skewed. It's a unimodal histogram with its peak at `$150,000-$155,000`
    
      <iframe src="assets/edaFirst.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
    
2. The Distribution of `salary_in_usd` with respect to `company_size`
    - **Observations**: We can derive from the overlaid histogram that the medium companies are generally taller than the smaller and the larger companies. This is because the dataset contains more data-points for medium-sized companies. The boxplots accompanying the histograms confirm that the medium sized companies have more outliers and a higher median than the other two groups.
  
      <iframe src="assets/edaSecond.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

3. The average `salary` and `salary_in_usd` as `work_year` increases
    - **Observations**: There is a steady increase in the mean `salary_in_usd` as the years increase. This could be explained by the usual rise in the general price level or inflation. However, the growth of the mean `salary` is quite peculiar. The `salary` column has a very high standard deviation, because of the disparities in the foreign ecxchange values of the different currencies. Thus, `salary_in_usd` provides a more standardized distribution of salaries.

### Hypothesis Testing üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of salaries of different company sizes is drawn from the same population, and any differences in the distribution are purely conincidental.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The differences in salaries are not purely coincidental

**Test Statistic**: Means

**p-value**: 0.0

**Conclusion**: It is highly unlikely that the difference in means are purely coincidental. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis.

## Part II : Predictive Analysis üîÆüîÆ

### Linear Regression üìàüìà
#### Framing the Problem üßÆ ü§î

**Prediction Problem**: Predict the salaries of data scientists in USD

**Response Variable**: `salary_in_usd`

**Regressors**: `work_year`, `employee_type`

**Evaluation Metric**: R¬≤

---

#### Baseline Model üß©
The Baseline Model uses `work_year` and `employee_type` as features. Our model procured a R^2^ score 0.01. This is an extremely poor score and it implies that the baseline model cannot quite capture the nature of the data points. 

<iframe src="assets/baseline.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

---

#### Final Model üèÜ
**Feature Engineering**: For the final model, we conducted further EDA and created more data visualizations. Here are the features we either considered or used for the final model:

1. `work_year` and `employment_type`: These two categorical variables were one-hot encoded. These variables seem closely related to the salary variable, as `salary_in_usd` increases with each `work_year` and the amount of compensation would depend on whether the employee is working full time, part time, or as freelance.

2. `company_size`: Deriving from the graph below, the size of the company is likely a factor in the compensation earned by its employees. We one-hot encoded this categorical feature as well.

<iframe src="assets/edaSecond.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

3. `experience_level`: The experience of the individual would assumably play a huge role in deriving their compensation. However, simply one-hot encoding would not be appropriate, as Executive level is more valued than intermediate level or entry level. Thus, we decided to ordinally encode this feature.

<iframe src="assets/exp_lvl.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

4. `remote_ratio`: From the overlaid histograms and boxplots below, it is apparent that `remote_ratio` is also closely related to `salary_in_usd`. This numeric feature was simply passed through the model and was not engineered.

Our final model procured a R^2^ score of 0.2, which is significant rise from the baseline model's score. However, this model can be further improved or maybe another model may fit the data better than Linear Regression. It is crucial to note that a R^2^ score of 0.2 is also significant because the response variable, **salary** is an economic variable that is affected by several macroeconomic and idustry factors.

### Multiclass Classification üìã
#### Framing the Problem üßÆ ü§î
**Prediction Problem**: Predict the experience level of data scientists

**Response Variable**: `experience_level`

**Features**: `employee_type`, `company_size`
